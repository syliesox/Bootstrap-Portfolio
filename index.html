                            <p>I am a high school math teacher by day, and a computer programmer by night! I have been teaching math for almost 9 years, and have taught literally every high school math course offered, with the exception of Statistics/AP Stats. I am currently in charge of Geometry and AP Calculus AB. 
                            </p>
                            <p>I have been programming for a few years, but haven't really stuck with it, so I am now back in the game! I previously attended bootcamps focusing on Ruby and Ruby on Rails, which proved to be difficult. I enjoy the challenges that programming brings, which helps improve my critical thinking skills. I am looking forward to working with a few more languages that will help make me employer ready!
                            </p>
                            <p>When I am not working or coding, I enjoy spending time with my family, especially my husband and 3-year-old daughter. We enjoy vacationing all the time and going on cruises to pretty much anywhere. We dream of going on a European cruise as well as an Australian cruise eventually. I also have a goal of not only visiting every state within the United States, but also their state capitols. I've accomplished many so far, but not as many as I would like. We plan our vacations around which states we have not been to yet.
                            </p>
                            <p>I am also an avid cat lover! We currently have two cats. <strong>Hanna Mae</strong> is a 15-year-old Torbie (Grey Tabby/Tortiseshell mix), who is very timid and likes to keep to herself - but don't worry, she'll let you know when she wants food! <strong>Wica</strong> is an 8-year-old Black and White Shorthair, who is extremely loving, and MUST have that human touch! You definitely won't forget that she's around because she loves being around people, although she can be shy at first, but that wears off very quickly!
                            </p>
