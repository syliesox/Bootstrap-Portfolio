                          <p>
                            I am a person who loves math, cats, coding and my family! (not necessarily in that order!)
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            I have been teaching high school math for 9.5 years, and I enjoy the challenges that it brings! Math has not always been near and dear to my heart, but it is now because over the years I have persevered through many math challenges and I believe it has made me a better person! I particularly enjoy Geometry and AP Calculus the most because of how visual and relatable to the real-world they can be, but any math topic can be fun and challenging at the same time.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            Within the last few years, I have been working on learning how to code, because I was intrigued with how there are some similarities to math. They both can be challenging, they force you to think and solve problems, but with coding, you can create some pretty awesome stuff! Things in the world of technology are always changing, so I am always eager to collaborate and learn new things to see how they can shape our world, one line of code at a time! Checkout my <a href="portfolio.html" style="color:#4aaaa5">portfolio page</a> to see what I've been up to!
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            In my spare time, I enjoy spending time with my family, especially my husband and 4-year-old daughter. We enjoy vacationing to pretty much anywhere (especially cruises!). One of my goals is to not only visit every state within the United States, but also their state capitols. I have also recently taken up a hobby of "diamond painting". It's very fun, relaxing, and takes absolutely no prerequisite knowledge to get started! I have finished a 2ft by 1.5ft version of <i>Starry Starry Night</i>, and am now moving on to my next challenge of a 4ft by 3ft nature scene! This will certainly take a while to complete!
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            I am an avid cat lover! We currently have two cats. <strong>Hanna Mae</strong> is a 16-year-old Torbie (Grey Tabby/Tortiseshell mix), who is very timid and likes to keep to herself - but don't worry, she'll let you know when she wants food! <strong>Wica</strong> is a 9-year-old Black and White Shorthair, who is extremely loving, and MUST have that human touch! You definitely won't forget that she's around because she loves being around people, although she can be shy at first, but that wears off very quickly!
